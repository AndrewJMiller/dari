## Introduction

We believe that working with data, whether they're simple blog posts or
something much more complex, is the most critical part of building any
application. It's also the most difficult and frustrating, because the
current generation of data access frameworks don't do enough to provide
you with all the information necessary to let you be productive as possible.

Dari was created at [PERFECT SENSE digital](http://www.perfectsensedigital.com/)
to make our work in handling data for a variety of clients in different
industries easier and more efficient. We wanted to create a comprehensive
toolset that spans every aspect of how data flows throughout your application.

This is the fruit of our work so far, and we wanted to share it with the
world. We hope you enjoy working with it as much as we do.

### Getting Started

Dari provides a Maven archetype to help you quickly set up a new web
application. After running the following command in a terminal, you'll
have a project directory named after the `artifacedId` you provided.

    mvn archetype:generate -B \
        -DarchetypeRepository=http://public.psddev.com/maven \
        -DarchetypeGroupId=com.psddev \
        -DarchetypeArtifactId=dari-app-archetype \
        -DarchetypeVersion=2.0-SNAPSHOT \
        -DgroupId=com.yourcompany \
        -DartifactId=yourproject

You can run the application using [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org)
through the [Cargo Maven plugin](http://cargo.codehaus.org/Maven2+plugin):

    mvn package cargo:run

After the web server starts up, you'll see the default welcome page when you
visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

The directory generated by the archetype is a standard Maven web project:

    pom.xml
    src/main/resources/settings.properties
    src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml

Dari reads all its configuration information from the `settings.properties`
file, and it's pre-configured to use the [H2 database engine](http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html)
as its default database.
